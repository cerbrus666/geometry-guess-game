What are the objects in this program?
- Message -> String ("Please enter some coordinates")
- Coordinate -> Float (10.1, 2.55)
- Rectangle -> ? (Not a built-in object, create new class for this)
- Point -> ? (Not a built-in objject, create a new class for this)

Development steps
1. Write down the objects on paper
2. Write a class for each object (ie. custom Point and Rectangle class)
3. Write methods for each class (Add method/function in the class, ie. what a Point/Rectangle can do?)
4. Calling the classes and their methods (Call/Instatiating the class to execute the program)
